From a climate perspective, cooking is not responsible for a substantial amount of emissions. Approximately 6% of residential home energy usage is for cooking. At this time, we have excluded it from our ratings.</div>
                  <div className="p2">A true all electric home with zero emissions would exclude gas for cooking. Luckily, there are excellent alternatives. Induction cooktops are more efficient than gas. They are safer and faster. If replacing your cooking appliance, we recommend looking into induction.</div>
